	<p>The label reads 14% and I'm pretty sure that's accurate.</p>

		<p>My mother put her leg on the table so I could read the size of her shoes on the sole.</p>
		<p><em>Size 37.</em> I said.</p>
		<p><em>Better don't go out when it's stormy.</em> my father noted.</p>

<p>I picked this one up at Lidl for less than 3 Euros.</p>

<p>We cracked it open for dinner and had some chicken wings with salad. The wine definitely fit that very well. The label recommends to have it with grilled meats.</p>

<p>It's a dry wine with a slightly fruity and sour taste. It's very pleasant to drink and definitely reminds me of some nice summer evenings.</p>

<p>I'll rate three things: The price, obviously; How pleasant it is to drink and whether or not the label looks good. Never judge a book by its cover. I don't think that applies to wine, though.</p>
